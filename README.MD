# Playtime Rewards

### What the hell is this?
Im glad you asked, this plugin will psychologically manipulate your minecraft server players into playing more by providing rewards for high playtime and leaderboard adding a competitive nature to your server... thats basically it...

### What actually works though?
- Playtime Leaderboard
- User Playtime Command
- Saving and loading data
- Welcome message
- Last Player Seen Command

## What if i want to contribute
Honestly, i dont think its worth it but like i guess you can, just please follow the general idea of the project (Function Casing, Class Casing, File Casing, etc.). Also ALWAYS USE translateAlternateColorCodes, never use ChatColor.COLOR, please, thanks, also the char for translation should always be "&" because its standard for the US keyboard
